## üî∑ What is DCL (Data Control Language)?

### ‚úÖ DCL deals with **permissions and access control** for users.

It is used to:

* **Grant** access rights to users
* **Revoke** access rights from users

---

### üîë Common DCL Commands

---

### ‚úÖ 1. `GRANT`

Gives **privileges** (permissions) to users to perform actions like SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, etc.

#### üß™ Example: Grant SELECT permission

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Students TO 'john'@'localhost';
```

#### üîç What this means:

* The user `john` (on localhost) can now **read data** from the `Students` table.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `REVOKE`

**Removes** previously granted permissions.

#### üß™ Example: Revoke SELECT permission

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON Students FROM 'john'@'localhost';
```

---

### üìå Other permissions include:

* `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* `ALL PRIVILEGES`: Grants all available permissions

#### üß† Real-life analogy:

Like giving or removing someone's **ID card access** to a building room.

---

## ‚úÖ Why DCL is important:

* üîê **Security**: Controls who can see or change data
* üßë‚Äçüíª **User roles**: Developers may only SELECT, admins can INSERT/DELETE
* üßÖ **Multi-layered access**: Restrict access based on role or responsibility

## üî∑ What is TCL (Transaction Control Language)?

### ‚úÖ TCL is used to **manage transactions** in SQL.

> A **transaction** is a group of one or more DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that should **either all succeed or all fail together**.

---

### üîë Main TCL Commands:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. `BEGIN` / `START TRANSACTION`

Starts a new transaction (used in many DBMS like MySQL/PostgreSQL).

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

Now your changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) are **not permanent** until you `COMMIT`.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `COMMIT`

Saves all changes made in the current transaction **permanently** in the database.

```sql
COMMIT;
```

‚úÖ Now your data is officially updated.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. `ROLLBACK`

**Undo** all changes made in the current transaction, going back to the state before the transaction began.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

üîÅ Very useful when something goes wrong ‚Äî you can cancel the operation safely.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. `SAVEPOINT`

Creates a **checkpoint** inside a transaction so you can **rollback to that specific point** instead of rolling back everything.

```sql
SAVEPOINT Save1;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`

Undoes changes only **after a specific savepoint**.

```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT Save1;
```

---

### üìå Real-life analogy:

Imagine filling a bank transfer form:

1. You start writing ‚Üí `START TRANSACTION`
2. You make entries ‚Üí `INSERT`, `UPDATE`
3. If something goes wrong ‚Üí `ROLLBACK`
4. If everything looks good ‚Üí `COMMIT`

---

## ‚úÖ Why TCL is important:

* üõ°Ô∏è Keeps data **consistent**
* üßæ Ensures **all-or-nothing** execution
* üí° Lets you **fix mistakes** before finalizing changes
