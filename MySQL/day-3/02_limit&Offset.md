## ‚úÖ 1. What is `LIMIT`?

`LIMIT` is used to **restrict the number of rows returned** from a query.

### üî∏ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

### üî∏ Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
```

üì§ This returns only the **first 5 rows** from the `products` table.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. What is `OFFSET`?

`OFFSET` tells MySQL to **skip a certain number of rows** before starting to return results.

### üî∏ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET number_to_skip;
```

### üî∏ Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

üì§ This skips the **first 10 rows** and then returns the **next 5 rows** (rows 11‚Äì15).

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Shorthand Syntax: `LIMIT offset, row_count`

You can also write it as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10, 5;
```

This is the same as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

---

## üß≠ Real-Life Use Case: Pagination

### Suppose you‚Äôre showing 10 products per page:

| Page | SQL Query            |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 1    | `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0`  |
| 2    | `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10` |
| 3    | `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20` |

So the formula for pagination is:

```sql
LIMIT page_size OFFSET (page_number - 1) * page_size
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Tips

* **`LIMIT` without `ORDER BY`** is unpredictable ‚Üí the order is not guaranteed.
* Always use `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` for consistent results.

‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
```

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Keyword      | Meaning                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `LIMIT n`    | Return first `n` rows only             |
| `OFFSET m`   | Skip the first `m` rows                |
| `LIMIT m, n` | Skip `m` rows and return next `n` rows |

## ‚úÖ 1. What does this do?

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 5;
```

### üîç Meaning:

* `ORDER BY RAND()` ‚Üí Randomizes the rows.
* `LIMIT 5` ‚Üí Returns **5 random rows** from the table.

### üß† So this returns:

> Any **5 random products** from your table ‚Äî the randomness changes every time you run it.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Warning:

* `ORDER BY RAND()` is **slow** on large tables.
* Why? Because it must:

  1. Generate a random number for **every row** in the table.
  2. Sort all rows by that random number.
  3. Then pick the first 5 rows.

#### ‚ùå On a large table (e.g., 1 million rows):

It generates 1 million randoms ‚Üí sorts them ‚Üí gives 5 ‚Üí **bad performance**.

---

### ‚úÖ Better Alternative (if you have an `id` column):

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE id >= (SELECT FLOOR(RAND() * (SELECT MAX(id) FROM products))) 
LIMIT 5;
```

This is **faster**, though not *perfectly random* if there are gaps in IDs ‚Äî but great for performance!

---

## ‚úÖ 2. What is the performance issue with high `OFFSET`?

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100000;
```

### ‚ùå This is inefficient because:

MySQL has to scan and **read through 100,000 rows**, discard them, and **then return 10 rows**.

### üí° Even though you're only getting 10 rows, MySQL *internally scans* the full offset range first.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact:

| Table Size      | OFFSET | Problem                               |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Small (1K rows) | 100    | No big deal                           |
| Medium (100K)   | 50K    | Starts to slow down                   |
| Large (1M+)     | 500K+  | Noticeably slow ‚Äî bad user experience |

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions / Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Use a **‚Äúseek method‚Äù** with indexed `id`:

Instead of this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100000;
```

Use this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id > last_seen_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
```

### Benefit:

* Much faster.
* Scales better for big data.

| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `ORDER BY RAND()`           | Random rows                | ‚ùå Slow for large data |
| `LIMIT x OFFSET y`          | Page rows, skip y rows     | ‚ùå Slow if y is big    |
| `LIMIT` with `WHERE id > x` | Fast pagination with index | ‚úÖ Fast                |

## ‚úÖ What is `last_seen_id`?

`last_seen_id` is **not a SQL keyword**, it‚Äôs just a **placeholder** representing:

> The **`id` of the last record** you saw on the previous page.

---

### üìò Context: Efficient Pagination

Suppose you're showing products page-by-page:

---

### üîπ Page 1 Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10;
```

Let‚Äôs say the last product on this page has:

```sql
id = 10
```

---

### üîπ Page 2 Query:

You want the **next 10 rows after id = 10**, so you use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE id > 10
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10;
```

Here, `10` is the `last_seen_id`.

---

## üí° So, in general:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE id > last_seen_id
ORDER BY id
LIMIT page_size;
```

* `last_seen_id`: the highest `id` value you saw on the previous page.
* `page_size`: how many records per page (e.g., 10, 20).

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits over `OFFSET`:

| Method                    | Reads internally            | Good for large data |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `LIMIT ... OFFSET ...`    | Scans all rows up to offset | ‚ùå No                |
| `WHERE id > last_seen_id` | Uses index directly         | ‚úÖ Yes               |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements:

* Your `id` column must be **unique and increasing** (like AUTO\_INCREMENT).
* This won‚Äôt work well if you sort by other fields (like `name` or `price`).
