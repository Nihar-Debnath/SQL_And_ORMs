Great question again! You're asking about the **`@` operator** in SQL (specifically MySQL).

Let’s clear it up fully 👇

---

## ✅ What is the `@` operator in MySQL?

### 🔹 `@` is **not a comparison operator**.

It's used for **user-defined session variables** in MySQL.

---

## ✅ Use of `@` in MySQL: Session/User Variables

### 🔹 Syntax:

```sql
SET @variable_name = value;
```

Or:

```sql
SELECT @variable_name := value;
```

These variables are:

* Created dynamically
* Available only in your current session
* Start with `@`

---

### ✅ Example 1: Simple variable assignment

```sql
SET @my_salary = 50000;
SELECT @my_salary;
```

📌 Output:

```
+------------+
| @my_salary |
+------------+
|     50000  |
+------------+
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Use in SELECT

```sql
SELECT name, salary, salary - @my_salary AS difference
FROM employees;
```

You can use `@my_salary` to compare against a column.

---

### ✅ Example 3: Assignment in query

```sql
SELECT @min_age := MIN(age) FROM employees;
```

This assigns the minimum age in the table to the variable `@min_age`.

Then you can reuse:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age = @min_age;
```

---

### ✅ Special Variable: `@@`

When you see **`@@`**, it’s for **system variables**, not session variables.

```sql
SELECT @@global.time_zone;
SELECT @@session.sql_mode;
```

---

## ❗ Important Notes

* `@` variables are **session-scoped** → lost when you disconnect.
* You can use them inside complex queries, loops, procedures.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Symbol | Meaning                          | Example              |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `@`    | Session variable (user-defined)  | `@total := 100`      |
| `@@`   | System variable (global/session) | `@@global.time_zone` |

Would you like a visual breakdown showing how session variables are assigned and reused in multi-step queries or procedures?
